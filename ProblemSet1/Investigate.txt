/*Question
- how to delay in c language: delay(ms) in stdlib.h,
- How to generate rand num in c language: rand():0..32768 or more
- broadcast or signal
- does need to signal from a reader to other reader when it finish
- does need to signal from a writer to other writer when it finish
- Where to increase number of reader: 
  - top of reader func 
  - or when reading shared variable: ok
  */

/* Variable */
int sharedVar = 0;
int numReader = 0;

void main(){

  create(tid2,writer);
  for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
  {
    join(tid1);
    join(tid2);
  }
}

/*Writer func*/
void writer(){
  for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
  {
    delay(rands);
    while(numReader != 0)? wait():write(sharedVar);
    printf("write value %d \n",i);
    printf("number of reader is %d \n",numReader); /*It should be = 0*/
  }
}

/*Reader function*/
void reader(){
  int readVal;
  for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
  {
    delay(rands);
    numReader++;
    readVal = read(sharedVar);

    (numReader == 0)?broadcast():;
    printf("read value %d \n",readVal);
